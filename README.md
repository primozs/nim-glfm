# GLFM

Working example from [treeform](https://github.com/treeform/glfm)

Wrapper of [GLFM](https://github.com/brackeen/glfm) (OpenGL ES and input for iOS and Android) library for Nim.

[GLFM](https://github.com/brackeen/glfm) very simple and is very simmilar to the [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) wrapper for desktop apps. Together with [GLFM](https://github.com/brackeen/glfm) + [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) you can writes app for almost any platform.

Compiling Nim for mobile platforms is not simple. It requires having XCode and Android Studio which have very many steps and settings they perform.

In this repo I have included two projects for XCode and Android Studio which you should be able to just open and hit compile.

# Compiling for iOS:

Tested with:

- MacOS Majave Version 10.14.6
- XCode Version 10.3 (10G8)
- Nim Compiler Version 0.20.99 [MacOSX: amd64]

`cp examples`

Compile everything for iOS:

`nim c -c --os:android main.nim`

(Yes saying android when compilng for iOS is very odd but its as close to mobile as you get)

Now copy the generated C files into the iOS project folder

`cp ~/.cache/nim/main_d/* ios_triangle/example/src/; cp ios_triangle/example/src/main.nim.c ios_triangle/example/src/main.c`

Then you go to XCode and hit compile:

# Compiling for Android

Tested with:

- MacOS Majave Version 10.14.6
- XCode Version 10.3 (10G8)
- Android Studio 3.4.2
- Nim Compiler Version 0.20.99 [MacOSX: amd64]

Go to the examples folder

`cp examples`

Compile everything for android running arm processor:

`nim c -c --cpu:arm --os:android main.nim`

Now copy the generated C files into the Android project folder

`cp ~/.cache/nim/main_d/* android_triangle/app/src/main/cpp/; cp android_triangle/app/src/main/cpp/main.nim.c android_triangle/app/src/main/cpp/main.c`

Then you go to Android Studio and hit compile:
